# Randomized

This Go program generates a random list of names or selects a single name based on the specified route and displays them in HTML. Itâ€™s ideal for workshops, demonstrations, random selections in group activities, and rotating daily tasks where everyone sees the same result for the day.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that Go is installed on your system.

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.
3. Run the following command to start the server:

   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to any of the example URLs to see the application in action.

## Usage

The application provides four main routes for randomizing or picking names:

### 1. `/shuffle/`

- Shuffles the list of names each time the URL is accessed.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080/shuffle/steve,tim,johnny
  ```
- The names will be randomly shuffled and displayed in an HTML list. Each refresh results in a different order.

### 2. `/pick/`

- Picks a single name randomly from the list each time the URL is accessed.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080/pick/steve,tim,johnny
  ```
- A random name is selected from the list and displayed. Each refresh may result in a different name.

### 3. `/pick-today/`

- Picks a single name but uses today's date as the seed, ensuring consistent results throughout the day.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080/pick-today/steve,tim,johnny
  ```
- The same name will be selected for the entire day. The result changes only once per day.

### 4. `/shuffle-today/`

- Shuffles the list of names using today's date as the seed, producing the same order throughout the day.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080/shuffle-today/steve,tim,johnny
  ```
- The order of names will remain the same for the entire day, refreshing only when a new day starts.

## Example URLs

- Shuffle names: `http://localhost:8080/shuffle/klaus,linus,jonas,julia`
- Shuffle names with today's seed: `http://localhost:8080/shuffle-today/klaus,linus,jonas,julia`
- Pick a name: `http://localhost:8080/pick/klaus,linus,jonas,julia`
- Pick a name with today's seed: `http://localhost:8080/pick-today/klaus,linus,jonas,julia`
